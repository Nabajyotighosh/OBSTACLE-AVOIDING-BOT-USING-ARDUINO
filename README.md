<h1>WELCOME TO NABAJYOTI'S GITHUB PAGE</h1>

The Project's aim to make a Bot which can operate by itself avoiding obstacle
which will come in front of it on its way. Ultra sonic sensor is used to 
sense the object in front of it.Servo motor alsop have been connected to 
move the sensor arround it And to check obstacle is there or not.
  

<h2>COMPONENT REQUIRED</h1>

1.ARDUINO

<h2>FUNCTION PREVIEW</h2>

In this project first the ultrasonic sensor measure the distance and send to arduino.arduino checks
the distance is very small or not if the distance is very less it stop the bot and turns the servo
motor to left and right and checks in which directin the distance is less.The direction in which 
the distance is less the arduino moves the bot in that direction.

<h2>CIRCUIT DIAGRAM</h2>

The ciruit diagram is given below only the HC-05 is not available here it will be connected to arduino
as the rx will be connected to arduino tx pin and tx pin will be connected to rx pin of arduino.
